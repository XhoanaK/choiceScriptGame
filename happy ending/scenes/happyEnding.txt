You look around and see that most characters have been paused.

You open you eyes, you notice that you have been laying in the floor this whole time.

You look around your room. Nothing has changed. The storm has ended, your laptop is back to normal.
You don't know if what happened was real or just a dream.


Next you shut down the laptop and go to bed.

"What a crazy day"
