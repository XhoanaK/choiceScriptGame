"It seems that you're not taking my advice seriously. I can't blame you, I was the same way too. But you need to
finish the mission otherwise you will end up like me. Waiting to be erased. " the mask guy tells you.

"Y...you are the one who gave me the note. Why am I here? I don't understand I never asked to be here." you tell the masked guy.

“how come you're still here?”  you ask him

“I was able to escape before the creator erased me completely, but he got my face. Now I can only live in the shadows,
and hide behind extra characters.

You need to try and finish your mission." he tells you.

"and what exactly is my mission. I don't understand, I don't have  a background in psychology how can I do this job."
you tell him as you sit down on the chair beside your desk.

"OH GOD I HAVE NEVER MET ANYONE AS FRUSTRATING AS YOU. The mission is PRETTY SIMPLE you just need to give good advice to
the characters and in a way that it can't hurt the flow of the story"

Someone knocks in your door, it is Naruto.

"You can sit down, make yourself comfortable and please state your name and age."  you tell Naruto.

A strange feeling of excitement fills your heart

since he is a little more mature.

"Hi my name is Naruto Uzumaki im 17 years old... wow this is so cool, so you will be my therapist? I don't think I need one but Lady Tsunade said that I have to attend

mind is occupied with Naruto and all of his achievements that he has done.

You can not believe that he is in front of you,
your idol is seating in front of you. Then you glance at your table and see note that that mystery man gave you. That brings
