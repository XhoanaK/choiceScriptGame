The time is 8:36 pm, you're on your way home after a long day of school. Your mind is occupied with
thoughts that have no meaning, your eyes are fixed on the dirty floors of the train trying to make a
figure out of it. Your focus is ruined when you realize that you get off next stop.
*image train1.jpg
You check the app transit in case there is a bus near so you don't have to walk 20 minutes home. The next
bus comes in 1 minute, the train is slowing down and you can see the platform. As soon as the doors open
you see the stairs. You take the same route everyday so you know which cart is closest to the stairs.

You see the bus down the block and then:

  #You start running to the bus stop.
    *image bbus.jpg left
    You felt your whole body working; your leg muscles running warm,
    fresh air entered your lungs and blood flowed into all of your limbs.
    The last time you ran this much was back in high school.
    Keeping your breath steady, you pushed harder and went faster until you arrived at the bus stop.

    Your breath came in short gasps as you took out your metro card.
    The ride was short and in a few minutes you were home.

  #You walk slowly as you see the bus go.

    You lower the volume of your music and start walking home, after 17 minute you arrive at your front door.
    You can't wait to take off your shoes and lay in your bed.
